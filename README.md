# White-paper-of-two-complementary-cryptocurrencies
Blockchain is a secure transactional system. The problem of bitcoin in the way of its emission is the replenishment of the system with coins. Mining is limited to the number of transactions; the credit system and the infusion of Fiat money is missing and is not required for lack of credit.
Fiat money - dollars are opaque system issue. The monetary system needs regular injections of unsecured money. Issuance of loans at -100% per annum. The problem is the limited access of market participants to such unsecured money. Therefore, the number of countries with a high standard of living is limited.
I propose a system that solves both of these shortcomings.
There are two currencies. "Real money" and "Credit money". Real money can always be bought and sold in any quantity with Commission. 
 
Credit money is given to the user on the security of real money for a limited period. The user has the right to sell or give credit money, while the user has a record of the amount of credit money taken referred to as debt. The user has the right to replace the debt with real money in the same amount plus interest to the system. Upon expiration of the term of issuance of credit money credit money unsubstituted removed together with the debt.
Real money that the user left as collateral is a Deposit for which the system charges interest with real money.
A person accepting credit money can guarantee the replacement of credit money with real money by requiring the user to provide a collateral or other obligation.
Transactions are carried out by blockchain technology, while the amount of remuneration for mining depends on the amount of money in transactions. Transactions are made with Commission.
The user has the right to update the debt. If the user has a debt, the user has the right to take a new debt. In this case, the user has the right to make a new debt old debt, and is obliged to make interest to the system for the old debt.
Transactions between the system and users are carried out using blockchain technology. The system is a blockchain user, in which an incoming transaction for the amount specified by the user is created when issuing credit and real money. The incoming transaction is sent to the user.
Credit money in this form are futures and can be traded with their risks on the exchange as a separate currency. 
Blocks should be collected from credit and real money at the same time to make payments to miners only in real money. To solve this problem, it is advisable to collect a block of credit money, a block of real money and use one solution for the implementation of both blocks.
